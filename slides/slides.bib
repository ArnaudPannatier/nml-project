  abstract = {{With the goal of making high-resolution forecasts of regional rainfall, precipitation nowcasting has become an important and fundamental technology underlying various public services ranging from rainstorm warnings to flight safety. Recently, the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model has been shown to outperform traditional optical flow based methods for precipitation nowcasting, suggesting that deep learning models have a huge potential for solving the problem. However, the convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models is location-invariant while natural motion and transformation (e.g., rotation) are location-variant in general. Furthermore, since deep-learning-based precipitation nowcasting is a newly emerging area, clear evaluation protocols have not yet been established. To address these problems, we propose both a new model and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting. Specifically, we go beyond ConvLSTM and propose the Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU) model that can actively learn the location-variant structure for recurrent connections. Besides, we provide a benchmark that includes a real-world large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Observatory, a new training loss, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol to facilitate future research and gauge the state of the art.}},

  abstract = {{The limited-area ensemble prediction system COSMO-LEPS has been running every day at ECMWF since November 2002. A number of runs of the non-hydrostatic limited-area model Lokal Modell (LM) are available every day, nested on members of the ECMWF global ensemble. The limited-area ensemble forecasts range up to 120h and LM-based probabilistic products are disseminated to several national and regional weather services. Some changes of the operational suite have recently been made, on the basis of the results of a statistical analysis of the methodology. The analysis is presented in this paper, showing the benefit of increasing the number of ensemble members. The system has been designed to have a probabilistic support at the mesoscale, focusing the attention on extreme precipitation events. In this paper, the performance of COSMO-LEPS in forecasting precipitation is presented. An objective verification in terms of probabilistic indices is made, using a dense network of observations covering a part of the COSMO domain. The system is compared with ECMWF EPS, showing an improvement of the limited-area high-resolution system with respect to the global ensemble system in the forecast of high precipitation values. The impact of the use of different schemes for the parametrisation of the convection in the limited-area model is also assessed, showing that this have a minor impact with respect to run the model with different initial and boundary condition.}},

  abstract = {{Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5–90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.}},
